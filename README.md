# A simple multigrid method for the biharmonic equation in 1d and 2d

Course project for AMSC763 (UMD, Fall 2021)

Author: Mansur Shakipov

The Biharmonic problem is solved using using Hermite Cubic Element in 1d, and Bogner-Fox-Schmit element in 2d. The mesh generation and matrix assembly routines are adopted from the code by Pedro Morin [1].
